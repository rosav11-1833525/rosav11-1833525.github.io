        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p style= font:bold> I was born and raised in Guadalajara, Jalisco Mexico. My family moved to the United States when I Was only 7 years old. I started the second grade at Brewster Elemantary in Brewster, Washington. I started school not knowing one single word in English. I worked hard throughout my second grade year and was able to fluently speak English by my thrird grade year.</p>
     <p style="font-style: oblique"> Both Brewster and Guadalajara are very distictive.Brewster is a very small town surrounded and merely based on cherry and apple orchards. The fruit industry is the heart and soul of Brewster. Although, I have not visited Guadalajara since I was 7, I do remember it being a very busy city like Seattle with lots of people moving in different directions. Although, they both have busyness in common they are culturally distinctive.</p>
